# Blockchain Fundamentals Workspace

This repository serves as a workspace to explore and understand the fundamentals of blockchain technology. Below are the key concepts, along with helpful links for further reading and learning.

## Blockchain Fundamentals

### 1. Decentralization
Blockchain operates without a central authority, allowing participants to interact directly, making it more secure and resilient.

### 2. Distributed Ledger
A blockchain is a distributed ledger that records all transactions across a network of computers. Each participant (node) holds a copy of the entire ledger.

### 3. Immutability
Once data is added to the blockchain, it is almost impossible to alter or delete it, ensuring integrity and trust in the recorded information.

### 4. Consensus Mechanisms
Blockchain uses consensus algorithms like **Proof of Work (PoW)** or **Proof of Stake (PoS)** to validate transactions and ensure agreement across the network.

- Learn more about PoW: [Proof of Work](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pow/)
- Learn more about PoS: [Proof of Stake](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/)

### 5. Cryptography
Cryptographic techniques secure data, transactions, and identities on the blockchain, protecting against fraud and unauthorized access.

### 6. Smart Contracts
Self-executing contracts that automatically enforce and execute the terms of an agreement based on predefined conditions, without the need for intermediaries.

- Learn more: [What are Smart Contracts?](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/)

### 7. Transparency
All transactions are visible to all participants, ensuring accountability, although encryption ensures sensitive information is secure.

### 8. Tokenization
Assets can be represented digitally on the blockchain through tokens, which can be traded or transferred across the network.
